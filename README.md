# Capstone-Notebook
project for class

This was a PHP project I did at Dunwoody College of Technology.  I wouldn't call it my best work ever by a long shot, there's no way I would have so much redundant code all over anything I build now, and I have embraced parameterized SQL queries, so the weak as crap queries and inputs here are not representative of what I can do now vs what I could do then.  Also, I'm a little horrified at myself for wanting to store images directly in a database (but also proud of myself for figuring out how to do it).

I'm leaving this project as is as kind of a reminder of where I was at when I first started out and how far I've come.  Am I the best coder ever?  Nope, and I make no claim to it.  But I will always work to better myself and my abilities, and remembering where one came from is important for that journey.
